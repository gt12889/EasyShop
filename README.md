Product Catalog Website 

## Description
The EasyShop website allows users to browse products in various categories, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout to order the products. The user interface (UI) is fully functional, providing features such as user registration, login, displaying products by category, and searching or filtering the products list. The focus of further changes and development will be on the backend Spring Boot Java API. 

Testing is conducted using Postman and scripts. By configuring Postman collections, writing test scripts in JavaScript, and analyzing the results, developers can ensure the functionality and compatibility of the API. Installation involves cloning the project repository, setting up the backend API, configuring dependencies, and connecting the frontend UI.
